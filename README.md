# Calculator with interchangeable themes

Users should be able to:

- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## Concepts

- Dinamic ClassList

## Languages and tools

- HTML
- SASS
- JAVASCRIPT


## Notes

This is the first time I used Sass. Very rapid workflow rather then classic CSS.  
I used Javascript to perform calculations and themes selection.

## Improvements

Make it responsive / add mobile query.
